##ToDo-List

## Hosted on [Github Pages](https://dbull7.github.io/2DoBox-pivot/)

To-Do List is a Turing School project. We were assigned a repository created by a pair of our fellow students from the previous weeks project: Idea-List. The goal of our project was to refactor the codebase, learn and run Selenium tests, and add new features.  


Our refactoring included: improving variable naming, fixing the css, making the Html semantic, and organizing/DRYing up the Javascript.


Our Selenium tests include: testing the persistence, validating input, checking is the save button is disabled, validating the search functionality, and validating card deletion.
